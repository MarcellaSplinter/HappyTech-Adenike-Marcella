Developing Web Application Case Study

The company HappyTechis growing and advertises a significant number of positions. Therefore, the number of applications they have to deal with is increasing too. The company’s policy is to respond to both the successful and unsuccessful applications by sending them feedback. As writing up letters for every applicant takes a lot of time, the company identified an ontology that could be used by a software application to generate the feedback. The feedback application will be used by anybody involved in reviewing the applications.

•a header containing relevant information about the person the feedback is for, the person giving the feedback and what the feedback is for (CV, interview, technical interview, etc) 

•a number of comments to be included in the feedback.The template can be used to review the applications for one or more positions advertised. 

2.Generate feedbackBefore the feedback writing process starts, the template to be used has to be selected.
